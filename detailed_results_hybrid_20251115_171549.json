These models consist of interconnected nodes or neurons that process data, learn patterns and enable tasks such as pattern recognition and decision-making. The image illustrates the analogy between a biological neuron and an artificial neuron, showing how inputs are received and processed to produce outputs. Each neuron in a layer receives inputs which are multiplied by the weights associated with the connections. These products are summed together and a bias is added to the sum. The result of the linear transformation (denoted The network evaluates its performance using a loss function which measures the difference between the actual output and the predicted output. The goal of training is to minimize this loss. Backpropagation comes into play: This process of forward propagation, loss calculation, backpropagation and weight update is repeated for many iterations over the dataset. Over time Let's consider a record of an email dataset: Email ID Email Content Sender Subject Line Label 1 \"Get free gift cards now!\" spam@example.com \"Exclusive Offer\" 1 To classify this email, we will create a feature Each neuron in the hidden layer performs two primary operations: a weighted sum and an activation function. The output value of approximately 0.636 indicates the probability of the email being spam. Since this value is greater than 0.5, the neural network classifies the email as spam. Unsupervised learning involves data without labeled output variables. Unlike supervised learning, there is no instructor to guide the process. There are seven types of neural networks that can be used. Reinforcement learning enables a neural network to learn through interaction with its environment. This approach is widely used in applications like gaming and decision-making.",
