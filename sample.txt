What is a Neural Network?
Last Updated : 07 Oct, 2025

Neural networks are machine learning models that mimic the complex functions of the human brain. These models consist of interconnected nodes or neurons that process data, learn patterns and enable tasks such as pattern recognition and decision-making.

Neural networks are capable of learning and identifying patterns directly from data without pre-defined rules. These networks are built from several key components:

    Neurons: The basic units that receive inputs, each neuron is governed by a threshold and an activation function.
    Connections: Links between neurons that carry information, regulated by weights and biases.
    Weights and Biases: These parameters determine the strength and influence of connections.
    Propagation Functions: Mechanisms that help process and transfer data across layers of neurons.
    Learning Rule: The method that adjusts weights and biases over time to improve accuracy.

Learning in neural networks follows a structured, three-stage process:

    Input Computation: Data is fed into the network.
    Output Generation: Based on the current parameters, the network generates an output.
    Iterative Refinement: The network refines its output by adjusting weights and biases, gradually improving its performance on diverse tasks.

In an adaptive learning environment:

    The neural network is exposed to a simulated scenario or dataset.
    Parameters such as weights and biases are updated in response to new data or conditions.
    With each adjustment, the network’s response evolves allowing it to adapt effectively to different tasks or environments.

Layers in Neural Network Architecture

Layers

    Input Layer: This is where the network receives its input data. Each input neuron in the layer corresponds to a feature in the input data.
    Hidden Layers: These layers perform most of the computational heavy lifting. A neural network can have one or multiple hidden layers. Each layer consists of units (neurons) that transform the inputs into something that the output layer can use.
    Output Layer: The final layer produces the output of the model. The format of these outputs varies depending on the specific task like classification, regression.

Working of Neural Networks
1. Forward Propagation

When data is input into the network, it passes through the network in the forward direction, from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer. This process is known as forward propagation. Here’s what happens during this phase:

1. Linear Transformation: Each neuron in a layer receives inputs which are multiplied by the weights associated with the connections. These products are summed together and a bias is added to the sum. This can be represented mathematically as:

    z=w1x1+w2x2+…+wnxn+bz=w1​x1​+w2​x2​+…+wn​xn​+b  

where

    ww represents the weights
    xx represents the inputs
    bb is the bias

2. Activation: The result of the linear transformation (denoted as zz) is then passed through an activation function. The activation function is crucial because it introduces non-linearity into the system, enabling the network to learn more complex patterns. Popular activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid and tanh.
2. Backpropagation

After forward propagation, the network evaluates its performance using a loss function which measures the difference between the actual output and the predicted output. The goal of training is to minimize this loss. This is where backpropagation comes into play:

    Loss Calculation: The network calculates the loss which provides a measure of error in the predictions. The loss function could vary; common choices are mean squared error for regression tasks or cross-entropy loss for classification.
    Gradient Calculation: The network computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the network. This involves applying the chain rule of calculus to find out how much each part of the output error can be attributed to each weight and bias.
    Weight Update: Once the gradients are calculated, the weights and biases are updated using an optimization algorithm like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The weights are adjusted in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss. The size of the step taken in each update is determined by the learning rate.

3. Iteration

This process of forward propagation, loss calculation, backpropagation and weight update is repeated for many iterations over the dataset. Over time, this iterative process reduces the loss and the network's predictions become more accurate.

Through these steps, neural networks can adapt their parameters to better approximate the relationships in the data, thereby improving their performance on tasks such as classification, regression or any other predictive modeling.
Example of Email Classification

Let's consider a record of an email dataset:
Email ID	Email Content	Sender	Subject Line	Label
1	"Get free gift cards now!"	spam@example.com	"Exclusive Offer"	1

To classify this email, we will create a feature vector based on the analysis of keywords such as "free" "win" and "offer"

The feature vector of the record can be presented as:

    "free": Present (1)
    "win": Absent (0)
    "offer": Present (1)

How Neurons Process Data in a Neural Network

In a neural network, input data is passed through multiple layers, including one or more hidden layers. Each neuron in these hidden layers performs several operations, transforming the input into a usable output.

1. Input Layer: The input layer contains 3 nodes that indicates the presence of each keyword.

2. Hidden Layer: The input vector is passed through the hidden layer. Each neuron in the hidden layer performs two primary operations: a weighted sum followed by an activation function.

Weights:

    Neuron H1: [0.5,−0.2,0.3]
    Neuron H2: [0.4,0.1,−0.5]

Input Vector: [1,0,1]

Weighted Sum Calculation

    For H1: (1×0.5)+(0×−0.2)+(1×0.3)=0.5+0+0.3=0.8
    For H2: (1×0.4)+(0×0.1)+(1×−0.5)=0.4+0−0.5=−0.1

Activation Function

Here we will use ReLu activation function:

    H1 Output: ReLU(0.8)= 0.8
    H2 Output: ReLu(-0.1) = 0

3. Output Layer: The activated values from the hidden neurons are sent to the output neuron where they are again processed using a weighted sum and an activation function.

    Output Weights: [0.7, 0.2]
    Input from Hidden Layer: [0.8, 0]
    Weighted Sum: (0.8×0.7)+(0×0.2)=0.56+0=0.56
    Activation (Sigmoid): σ(0.56)=11+e−0.56≈0.636σ(0.56)=1+e−0.561​≈0.636

4. Final Classification:

    The output value of approximately 0.636 indicates the probability of the email being spam.
    Since this value is greater than 0.5, the neural network classifies the email as spam (1).

Learning of a Neural Network
1. Learning with Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, a neural network learns from labeled input-output pairs provided by a teacher. The network generates outputs based on inputs and by comparing these outputs to the known desired outputs, an error signal is created. The network iteratively adjusts its parameters to minimize errors until it reaches an acceptable performance level.
2. Learning with Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves data without labeled output variables. The primary goal is to understand the underlying structure of the input data (X). Unlike supervised learning, there is no instructor to guide the process. Instead, the focus is on modeling data patterns and relationships, with techniques like clustering and association commonly used.
3. Learning with Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning enables a neural network to learn through interaction with its environment. The network receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, guiding it to find an optimal policy or strategy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time. This approach is widely used in applications like gaming and decision-making.
Types of Neural Networks

There are seven types of neural networks that can be used.

    Feedforward Networks: It is a simple artificial neural network architecture in which data moves from input to output in a single direction.
    Singlelayer Perceptron: It has one layer and it applies weights, sums inputs and uses activation to produce output.
    Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): It is a type of feedforward neural network with three or more layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer. It uses nonlinear activation functions.
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): It is designed for image processing. It uses convolutional layers to automatically learn features from input images, enabling effective image recognition and classification.
    Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): Handles sequential data using feedback loops to retain context over time.
    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A type of RNN with memory cells and gates to handle long-term dependencies and avoid vanishing gradients.
